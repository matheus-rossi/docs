# Agents

## What is an Agent?

Agents are intelligent programs that can autonomously solve complex problems by combining reasoning, memory, and tool usage. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that generate responses based on prompts, agents can take actions, make decisions, and adapt their approach based on changing contexts.

## LLMs vs Agents: Key Differences

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Purpose**: Generate text based on input prompts
- **Interaction**: Single request-response cycle
- **Capabilities**: Text generation, analysis, summarization
- **Memory**: No persistent memory between conversations
- **Tools**: Cannot use external tools or APIs
- **Decision Making**: Limited to generating appropriate responses
- **Autonomy**: Requires human guidance for each step

### Agents
- **Purpose**: Autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems
- **Interaction**: Continuous, iterative problem-solving process
- **Capabilities**: Planning, reasoning, tool usage, task execution
- **Memory**: Persistent memory across interactions and sessions
- **Tools**: Can use APIs, databases, web search, code execution, etc.
- **Decision Making**: Can plan, execute, evaluate, and adapt strategies
- **Autonomy**: Can work independently with minimal human intervention

## Levels of Agent Autonomy

Instead of a binary definition, agents exist on a spectrum of autonomy and capability:

### Level 0: Basic LLM (No Agency)
- Simple prompt-response interaction
- No tools or persistent memory
- Example: Basic chatbot for answering questions

### Level 1: Tool-Enabled Agents
- Can use external tools and APIs
- Basic autonomous task execution
- Limited memory and planning

### Level 2: Knowledge Agents
- Persistent memory and learning
- Domain-specific knowledge integration
- Advanced reasoning and context awareness

### Level 3: Multi-Agent Systems
- Teams of specialized agents
- Complex workflow orchestration
- Collaborative problem-solving


## Agent Design Patterns

### 1. ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting)
Alternates between reasoning about the problem and taking actions.

```python
def react_loop(agent, task: str) -> str:
    """ReAct pattern implementation"""
    state = {"task": task, "completed": False}
    
    while not state["completed"]:
        # Reason about current state
        thought = agent.reason(state)
        
        # Decide on action
        action = agent.plan_action(thought, state)
        
        # Execute action
        observation = agent.execute_action(action)
        
        # Update state
        state = agent.update_state(state, thought, action, observation)
    
    return state["result"]
```

### 2. Plan-Execute Pattern
Creates a comprehensive plan before execution.

```python
def plan_execute(agent, goal: str) -> str:
    """Plan-Execute pattern implementation"""
    plan = agent.create_detailed_plan(goal)
    
    for step in plan.steps:
        result = agent.execute_step(step)
        if not result.success:
            plan = agent.replan(plan, result.error)
    
    return agent.compile_final_result(plan)
```

### 3. Reflection Pattern
Continuously evaluates and improves performance.

```python
def reflection_loop(agent, task: str) -> str:
    """Reflection pattern implementation"""
    attempt = 1
    max_attempts = 3
    
    while attempt <= max_attempts:
        result = agent.attempt_task(task)
        evaluation = agent.self_evaluate(result, task)
        
        if evaluation.meets_criteria():
            return result
        
        feedback = agent.generate_self_feedback(evaluation)
        agent.incorporate_feedback(feedback)
        attempt += 1
    
    return result  # Return best attempt
```

## Building Effective Agents

### Key Principles

1. **Clear Goal Definition**: Agents need well-defined objectives and success criteria
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Agents must gracefully handle failures and adapt
3. **Efficient Tool Usage**: Strategic selection and usage of available tools
4. **Memory Management**: Effective storage and retrieval of relevant information
5. **Continuous Learning**: Ability to improve performance over time

### Common Challenges

1. **Tool Selection**: Choosing the right tool for each subtask
2. **Context Management**: Maintaining relevant context across long interactions
3. **Error Recovery**: Handling failures and finding alternative approaches
4. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing thoroughness with efficiency
5. **Safety and Reliability**: Ensuring agents behave predictably and safely
