## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Types of feature engineering techniques:

* Feature Preprocessing
  * Updating or transforming existing features 
* Feature Generation
  * Creating new features from existing features
