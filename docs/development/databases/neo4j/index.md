# Neo4j

## Graph Database

Neo4j is a native graph database, which means that it implements a true graph model all the way down to the storage level. The data is stored as you whiteboard it, instead of as a "graph abstraction" on top of another technology. Beyond the core graph, Neo4j also provides: ACID transactions, cluster support, and runtime failover.
