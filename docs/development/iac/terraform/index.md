# Terraform

## Terraform or Tofu?

Recently, terraform has changed it's license and the community is not happy about it. 
The license change is not compatible with the open source spirit and the community is looking for alternatives. 

Tofu is the new fork of terraform, completely compatible with terraform and oss.
