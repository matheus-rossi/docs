# Development

## Who am I ?

Hey, I’m Matheus Sandrini Rossi

Someone who loves building data pipelines, playing with AI and developing with Python. 

I’ve been doing this for a while now (almost 10 years), from setting up real-time data systems in the wild to automating stuff with Kubernetes and Terraform just because it’s fun.

Recently, I've been working with LLMs, embeddings, all the hype involved in this area.

I keep this wiki where I drop everything I learn (because I’ll forget otherwise), and I share a bunch of practical guides and random nerdy stuff about databases, cloud, AI … whatever I’m into at the moment.

At the end of the day, I just like solving real problems and helping other people do the same, no fancy titles, no buzzwords, just building cool things and sharing the journey.
