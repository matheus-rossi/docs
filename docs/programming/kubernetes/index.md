[K8s - Official Docs](https://kubernetes.io/pt-br/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, 
that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 
It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.



## K3D

![K3D](./k3d.png)

k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.

### Requirements

* docker to be able to use k3d at all
* kubectl to interact with the Kubernetes cluster

[K3D - Official Docs](https://k3d.io/v5.5.1/)

```bash
brew install k3d
```

### Create Cluster

Creating K8s cluster in one line.

::: tip
If you wanna expose your cluster in the local networ, provide your machine IP in --tls-san section.
:::

### Usage
```bash
k3d cluster create <CLUSTER_NAME> --agents 4 --servers 1 --k3s-arg "--tls-san=<YOUR_MACHINE_IP>@server:*"
```

Real Example
```bash
k3d cluster create home --agents 4 --servers 1 --k3s-arg "--tls-san=192.168.0.243@server:*"
```

List Clusters
```bash
k3d cluster list
```
